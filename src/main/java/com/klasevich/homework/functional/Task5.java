/**
 * <p>
 * Write a collector that partitions all words in a stream into two groups:
 * palindromes (true) and usual words (false). The collector should return Map<Boolean, List<String>>.
 * All input words will be in the same case (lower).
 * <p>
 * Let's remind, a palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same backward or forward,
 * such as noon or level. In our case, a palindrome is always a word.
 * For details, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome
 * <p>
 * Hint: the method reverse() of StringBuilder may help you.
 * <p>
 * Important. You should write only the collector in any valid formats but without ; on the end.
 * It will be passed as an ï»¿argument to the collect() method of a stream as shown below.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Sample Input 1:
 * aaaa aaa a aa
 * Sample Output 1:
 * {false=[], true=[aaaa, aaa, a, aa]}
 * Sample Input 2:
 * level bbaa ac
 * Sample Output 2:
 * {false=[bbaa, ac], true=[level]}
